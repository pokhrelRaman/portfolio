title: "Mailo Driver (Open-World Driving Experimental Project)"
publishedAt: "2025-01-10"
summary: "Developed a custom car controller in Unity for an open-world driving game, overcoming challenges with Wheel Colliders and fine-tuning suspension, friction, and handling dynamics. To enhance the simulator experience, I also created a hardware-based controller, providing a more immersive and realistic driving feel. This project deepened my passion for car mechanics and physics, and I aspire to work professionally in vehicle simulation and driving game development."
