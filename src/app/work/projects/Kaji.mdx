title: "Kaji – Educational 2D Platformer"
publishedAt: "2025-01-10"
summary: "Designed and developed an educational 2D platformer to teach kids about healthy eating habits. Players navigate through 
levels, avoiding enemies while learning the effects of different foods. Eating healthy food boosts health and jump power, whereas 
junk food reduces them. Players can plant up to two trees for instant health and power recovery, with trees providing random healthy 
food. The game features a simple shooting mechanic where players throw sticks to defeat enemies, with damage influenced by food 
choices. It also educates players about food poisoning, where consuming certain food combinations (e.g., maize and jackfruit) leads to
 death. Reason of death is also displayed to players. "
