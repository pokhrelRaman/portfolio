## Overview

In this project, my primary focus was on LAN gameplay and networking. Additionally, I developed and implemented various features, including audio managers, settings, adaptive UI, animations, daily tasks, free coins, and dashboard updates etc. Worked on almost 50% features of the game. 

## Key Features

- **LAN Multiplayer**: Built a feature allowing players to play CallBreak game in local network. Utilized Netcode's custom messaging and network variables for communication between players.
- **Online Multiplayer**: Developed multiplayer features, including playing with friends, room codes, player invites, and quick chat, to enhance the social aspect of the game.
- **Turn based game**: Created turn based system to identify player turn and sync turn data over the network.
- **Score and bidding system** fixed the issue in the score and bidding system and integrated it with a stable network architecture using Unity Netcode's custom reliable messaging. This ensured that all clients received packets and that the calculations were fair and consistent across devices, resulting in more reliable packet transmission which fixed score system.
- **Adaptive UI**: Implemented UI for 60% of game ensuring a responsive and engaging user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.     
- **Settings**: Implemented a settings menu for players to adjust preferences such as audio, graphics, and controls.
- **NativeShare**: Integrated NativeShare functionality to allow players to share room links and score.
- **Android and IOS**: Worked and created build for both android and IOS.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: Game development.
- **Github**: Version control.
- **Visual Studios**:  IDE.
- **Nakama**: Backend services.
- **Azure boards**: Boards management.
- **Xcode**:  To upload game on IOS device.

## Challenges and Learnings

The key challenge I faced was identifying the cause of the unreliable score system. Although everything appeared to be working fine, the score would occasionally become inconsistent. Since I was fixing the work of a previous developer, I had to thoroughly recheck and refactor the old code. Through this process, I learned the difference in handling game flow for turn-based games versus fast-paced games. 

## Outcome

The game is released on google playstore and soon to be released on App store.
